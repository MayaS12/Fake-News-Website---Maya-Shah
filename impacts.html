            <p style="font-family: Zilla Slab, serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; margin-right: 700px; margin-left: 15px;"> Fake news has a number of negative consequences, including deceiving or manipulating you into believing false information, which may cause you to make an incorrect decision based on that information. This may have an influence on your views, values, morality, and ideals, as well as your ability to vote. Following incorrect news, whether it's political, medical, intellectual, or personal, may be harmful. Another negative effect of false news is that you may agree with it and want to accept it because you have a prejudice against it, but this may lead to individuals feeling even more validated based on inaccurate information. Another negative effect of fake news is that it causes people to mistrust legitimate scientific study and to dispute genuine established truths by experts who have demonstrated them time and time again. With the growth of the internet and social media, it is becoming much easier to spread fake news and have people believe it because it aligns with their beliefs, and then dismiss anything that contradicts it as lies, even when presented with facts and figures that have been proven to be true by scientists and governments. </p>
